At my first rotation of work at LexisNexis, I migrated many product services to deploy using the shared release pipeline. I worked with AWS CloudFormation, EC2, System Manager, and Jenkins throughout this process. I also tested and implemented the service conversion from using two Classic Elastic Load Balancers to using a single Application Load Balancer for a yearly estimated savings of $200k. During my second rotation, I worked on providing CI/CD in Azure DevOps Pipelines as our team moved away from Jenkins. I set up automation to create and manage the linux agents that run the workloads. I managed the Azure Pipeline Agents with custom EC2 AMIs, Docker, Ansible, and Packer.
