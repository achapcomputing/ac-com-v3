I worked alongside a Computer Science professor to develop a web portal for researchers in the College of Veterinary Medicine. The goal was to collect and disseminate information about influenza among poultry populations in North Carolina farms. I designed and implemented user authentication and authorization systems with MariaDB (MySQL), Express.js, JSON Web Token, and Passport.js to specify data access rights. Additionally, I secured sensitive user information displayed by Nextrain (open source) data visualization using recursive Javascript functions
