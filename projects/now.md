This year I am graduating with a degree in Computer Science from North Carolina State University with minors in Religious Studies and Economics.

As of October 2021, I have been learning to play the banjo and attending various bluegrass jams around Raleigh, NC.

For fun, I like to move my body out of doors. This includes rowing, running, rockclimbing, disc golfing, and yoga.

The rest of my time is spent reading (The Name of the Wind series) or playing video games (Witcher 3 and Stardew Valley).
