My time at Cisco included much feature development in Django and Redis. Additionally, I reduced resource utilization measured by decommissioning 4 virtual machines by converting a monolithic, legacy Django application to a microservices-based, containerized deployment via Kubernetes, Spinnaker, and OpenShift. I also created multipled dashboard in Splunk to ease our auditing process. I also worked on infrastructure resource creation and management through Terraform. The IT team I was on is aiming to build a single portal for all developers to provision and manage IT infrastructure.
